## Dynamic styles
All the dynamic styles are generated in the file **_includes/styles.html** which is imported in the header.html in the same dir. The header is included in every page. **styles.html** uses variables to define global site colors according to the site's branding. These variables may be changed in **_config.yml**. At the _includes folder you can also find the menu-bar.html, the menu.html, the footer.html and the breadcrumb.html. If you want to change css rules all the css are in the **_sass** folder in the **main.scss**
